Yo wassup, welcome to the blackbox repo. Blackbox is a web app that stores (nearly) all of my personal notes, so it sort of acts as a database. Not really sure why I named it blackbox, just thought it sounded kinda cool ðŸ¤·.

### Content

Everyone needs an access code which honestly isn't very hard to find, it'll probably take 1 minute max if you're smart about it.

Once access code is found, type it in and you should be able to **VIEW** all of my notes. The web app stores your session data so no need to save the access code once you enter it.

A trusted few will have admin permission which will allow them to upload and delete entries.

### Development

**Notice:**
The below steps aren't everything for the complete setup of the project. Make sure to connect to your own Firebase project and store the tokens in a .env.local file. You guys are smart though so just Google how to do that.

Feel free to clone this repository to create something similar.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WarrenWu4/blackbox.git
```

Navigate to root directory

```bash
cd blackbox
```

Install packages

```bash
npm i
```

Start local server

```bash
npm start
```

Have fun playing around with this repo ðŸ˜„
